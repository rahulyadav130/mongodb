To enable mongodb replication follow the below steps-
1. Install mongodb on three VM or container
2. edit the configuration file
    /etc/mongod.conf
    replication:
       replSetName: "rs0"
 save and close the file, and restart mongod service
 
 3. repeate step 2 in other 2 vms as well.
 4. login on any machine which you want to act as primary and enter the below command-
      # access mongo shell "mongo"    
        rs.initiate()
        ## above command will initialize replica set and then you can add other 2 machine as secondary-
        rs.add("secondarydb.example.com:27017")
        You can then add in the third server which will be the Arbitrator. Note to make this an Arbitrator you need to specify truewhen you add it to the set.
        rs.addArb("secondarydb1.example.com:27017")
        
        
     Done!!!!!
5. you can verify the replication config-
rs.config()
6. you can also check the replication status
rs.status()
6. You can create a collection to verify replication work not --- create a collection
db.hello.insert({ "name":"Iam" })
7. go to other seconadry db vm and access mongo shell and enter below coomand
    rs.slaveOk()
   show collections
   # will print available collection
